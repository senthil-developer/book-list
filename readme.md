# Simple Book List with OOP in Vanilla JS

## Description

This project is a **simple book list application** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in **vanilla JavaScript**. It utilizes **Bootstrap** for styling to create a clean and responsive interface. The application allows users to add books to a list, view the list, and persists the book data using **local storage**.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Enter book details to add them to the list.
- **View Books**: Display the added books in a neatly formatted list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses local storage to save the book list, so data persists even after a page reload.
- **OOP Structure**: Demonstrates the use of JavaScript classes to manage book objects and list operations.
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Utilizes Bootstrap for a responsive and modern design.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and basic styling.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and UI components.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic behavior and application logic.
- **Local Storage**: For persisting data across page reloads.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Used for managing the book list and its interactions.
